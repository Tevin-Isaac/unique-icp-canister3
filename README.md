# Review ICP Canister

In this project I was learning how to create a smart contract on ICP using Typescript using a tutorial on Dacade. 

## Built With

- Typescript
- Azle

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To get this project up and running locally:
- [Installation Requirements for Internet Computer: Node.js 18, dfx, Rust](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OW3oT8F9pumYg3hmybrHFB8T0VpDwDgRVE5PfVkHFJI/edit?usp=sharing)

**simple steps set up on your local machine**

```
- $ git clone `$ git clone https://github.com/jebitok-dev/unique-icp-canister`
- Run `cd unique-icp-canister`
- $ dfx start --background
- $ dfx deploy
```

### Project Details 
- I wrote a smart contract for users writing reviews on different websites they can get, add and update reviews. 
- I'm thinking if possible we can make the delete unavailable since it's not good to delete users reviews and maybe on an improved smart contract we can limit update to private so that only the site owners might update or maybe delete review if its necessary
